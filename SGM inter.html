    <h4>Introduction</h4>    
  </div>
  <div class="eco-text">
      <p>The Solow growth model explains economic growth as a consequence of capital accumulation under the assumption that population growth (and maybe also technological progress) is constant. Agents in the economy save a certain amount of what is produced each period, and use all savings for investment in new capital. The amount of investment must be sufficient to replace depreciated capital, equip new workers with capital as the population grows (everyone in the population is part of the labour force), and equip them with new capital as technology improves (there is no use giving new workers a horse to pull a plough if current workers are using tractors). If investment is greater than this amount, the capital stock per worker will grow over time, if it is less than this amount, the capital stock per worker will shrink over time. When investment exactly offsets the forces decreasing the per worker capital stock, the economy is said to be in a steady state and there will be no tendency for the per worker capital stock to grow any further. This is also true of output per worker, it too will have no tendency to change in the steady state. However, because the population and (maybe) technology are growing, capital per worker and output per worker can only be constant if the capital stock and output are growing over time at the same rate. Thus, the Solow model provides an explanation as to why economies grow over time.</p>
      
    <p>This page uses the assumptions normally encountered in undergraduate macroeconomics courses to derive the steady state condition and shows how the economy adjusts to this steady state in the long run. There is also a numerical example at the end which you can interact with to see how changing the parameters changes the solution. I show all the steps taken to derive and solve the equations, and pause to comment on the economic intuition. Overall, this should be of use to undergraduates who want a more mathematically complete summary of the model compared to what macroeconomic textbooks provide without being too technically demanding.</p>

<div class="section-head">    
    <h4>Assumptions</h4>    
  </div>
  <div class="eco-text">
    <p>A country produces an output good \(Y\) with some amount of capital \(K\) and labour \(L\) according to the Cobb-Douglas production function \[Y = K^a L^b \tag{1} \] where \(a\) reflects the elasticity of output with respect to capital and \(b = 1-a \), which means the production function exhibits constant returns to scale (CRS). This means that multiplying the amount of capital and labour used in production by a constant scale factor will lead to an increase in output by the same scale factor, hence, doubling both the inputs means doubling output, multiplying all inputs by 3 means multiplying the original level of output by 3, and so on. As will be shown below the CRS assumption will allow us to solve the model in terms of \(y = \frac{Y}{L} \) as a function of one variable \(k = \frac{K}{L}\). This is not possible under the assumption of increasing or decreasing returns to scale.</p>
    <p>Beyond mathematical convenience, Solow believed that CRS was the most natural assumption for the aggregate economy. There would have to be some reason why a scale increase in all inputs would not lead to a proportional increase in output. For example, decreasing returns to scale is possible if there is limited land into which the economy can expand the capital stock and quantity of labour, then we can imagine that building new factories and increasing the number of workers creates congestion and prevents output increasing by the same scale factor as the inputs. Increasing returns to scale is possible if more factories and workers results in better production methods through an increase in knowledge sharing.</p>
    <p>Ouput is increasing in both inputs and both inputs exhibit diminishing marginal product, which means \(0 < a < 1 \). This implies that each successive unit of capital or labour adds a little bit less to output compared to the previous unit, holding the other input constant. It seems intuitive that adding more and more labour to a fixed capital stock will eventually lead to workers getting in each others way and will prevent an additional worker making the same marginal contribution as the one before.</p>
    <p>The growth in the supply of labour is equal to the growth in the general population, which is assumed to be a constant \(n\). Therefore, let \( L = L_0 e^{nt} \), where \(L_0 > 0 \) is the initial stock of labour. You can see this function implies a constant growth rate because \[ \frac{dL/dt}{L} = \frac{n L_0 e^{nt}}{L_0 e^{nt}} = n. \] For any variable \(x\), \(\frac{dx/dt}{x} \) is the continuous time equivalent of the way we calculate percentage changes in \(x\) in discrete time, \(\frac{x_{t} - x_{t-1} }{x_{t-1}} \). With population growth fixed, the Solow model aims to determine the growth of the capital stock and the growth of output. To do this, all savings made in the economy are assumed to be invested into building the capital stock, and savings are assumed to be a constant fraction of output, \(s\). Most textbooks will also assume that some capital needs to be replenished each period due to depreciation, which occurs at the constant rate \(\delta \). Therefore, gross investment in the economy is comprised of the amount of capital required to replace depreciation and the rest goes towards building the capital stock. Combining these two assumptions, the change in the capital stock over time is \[\frac{dK}{dt} = sY - \delta K = s K^a L^b - \delta K \tag{2}\].</p>

    <h4>Capital per Worker and Output per Worker</h4>    
  </div>
  <div class="eco-text">
    <p>Solow presented a solution to the above differential equation by transforming it into one which relates \(y\) to \(k\). To see why this can help us, note that \[ \frac{d}{dt} \frac{K}{L} = \frac{(L)(dK/dt) - (K)(dL/dt)}{L^2} = \frac{dK}{dt} \frac{1}{L} - \frac{dL}{dt} \frac{K}{L} \frac{1}{L} .\] Here I have just applied the quotient rule to find the derivative of \(K / L\) with respect to time and then cancelled out the common terms on the numerator and the denominator. We have expressions for \(dK / dt\) and \(dL / dt\) which we can substitute into this equation, along with the definitions of \(y\) and \(k\) to find that \[\frac{d}{dt} \frac{K}{L} = \left(s \frac{Y}{L} - \delta \frac{K}{L} \right) - n L_0 e^{nt} \frac{K}{L} \frac{1}{L_0 e^{nt}} \] \[\frac{dk}{dt} = sy - (\delta + n) k.\] Looking more closely at \(y\), we can see the important role of CRS in getting to Solow's solution in the Cobb-Douglas case \[y = \frac{K^a L^b}{L} = K^a L^{b-1} = \frac{K^a}{L^{1-b}}.   \] Notice that in the case where \(a = 1-b\), we can write \(y\) simply as \(k^a\). Now the differential equation only contains one variable, which makes it relatively easy to solve \[\frac{dk}{dt} = s k^a - (\delta + n) k. \tag{3}\] What we now have is an equation telling us the time dynamics of capital per worker. A constant portion of output per worker is saved at every instant and goes towards building the per worker capital stock. At the same time, growth in the population and depreciation of the capital stock means that the capital labour ratio will fall slightly at each instant of time.</p>

   <div class="section-head">    
    <h4>Solution</h4>    
  </div>
  <div class="eco-text">
    <p>We are dealing with a first order (ordinary) non-linear differential equation. Sometimes it is possible to find a solution to these directly, however, a good first step is to see if there is some manipulation which will allow us to convert it into a linear differential equation. Then we are in familiar territory. I have a page which gives an overview of ordinary linear differential equations elsewhere on this site but I will provide enough detail to make the following steps comprehensible without reading that page first. In this case, the trick to convert this equation into a linear differential equation is to multiply though by \(k^{-a} \) and then define \(z = k^{1-a} \) which gives \[ \frac{dk}{dt} k^{-a} = s - (\delta + n) k^{1-a}. \] Now note that by the chain rule \[ \frac{dz}{dt} = (1-a) k^{-a} \frac{dk}{dt} \] which can now be sustituted into the equation along with \(z\) to yield \[ \frac{dz}{dt} = (1-a)s - (1-a)(\delta + n) z. \tag{4}\] Now we have a linear differential equation in \(z\) which has a constant coefficient on \(z\) and another constant \(s\). These types of equations have general solutions comprised of a homogeneous and a non-homogeneous solution. The non-homogeneous solution is given by any value of \(z\) which can solve the equation. If we set \(z = c_1\) where \(c_1\) is some generic constant, then we can see that \(z\) will satisfy the differential equation if \(c_1 = \frac{s}{\delta + n}\) because the derivative of \(z\) with respect to time will be a constant. Therefore, the non-homogeneous solution is \[z = \tfrac{s}{\delta + n} .\] It is called the non-homogeneous solution because if we scaled the independent variable \(t\) by some scale factor, we can see that \(z\) would not change, so there is not a proportionate increase in the dependent variable. This is not the full solution to the differential equation though. That is because we could feasibly have \(s = 0\). In this case, we can solve the differential equation directly through integration \[\int \frac{1}{z} dz = - \int (1-a) (\delta + n) dt \] \[ln(z) = -(1-a) (\delta + n) t + c \] \[ z = e^{-(1-a) (\delta + n) t + c} = z_0 e^{-(1-a) (\delta + n) t}. \] This equation says that without saving, which is equal to investment, the per worker capital stock will decrease over time at a constant rate \((1-a) (\delta + n)\).</p>
      
    <p>Combining the homogeneous and non-homogeneous solutions gives the general solution in terms of \(z\) \[z = z_0 e^{-(1-a) (\delta + n) t} + \tfrac{s}{\delta + n}. \] The last step before transforming this equation back in terms of \(k\) is to determine the constant of integration \(z_0\). This is achieved by setting \(z = z(0)\) and \(t = 0 \) in the last equation, then rearranging and solving for \(z_0\). \[z(0) = z_0 + \tfrac{s}{\delta + n} \hspace{3mm} \rightarrow  \hspace{3mm} z_0 = z(0) - \tfrac{s}{\delta + n} \] \[z = \left(z(0) - \tfrac{s}{\delta + n} \right) e^{-(1-a) (\delta + n) t} + \tfrac{s}{\delta + n}.\] This means that the general solution for the capital labour ratio is \[ k = \left[ \left( k(0)^{1-a} - \tfrac{s}{\delta + n} \right) e^{-(1-a) (\delta + n) t} + \tfrac{s}{\delta + n} \right]^{\frac{1}{1-a}}. \tag{5} \] The first term in this equation is the initial deviation from the long run equilibrium or `steady state' given by \( \left( \tfrac{s}{\delta + n}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-a}} \). Because it is multiplied by \(e\) raised to a negative power, this term will go to zero as the amount of time that passes becomes very large. If \(k(0)\) is greater than the steady state capital to labour ratio, \(k\) will decrease over time towards the steady state. Conversely, \(k\) will increase over time towards the steady state if \(k(0)\) is below the steady state ratio. The long-run equilibrium depends positively on the savings rate, negatively on the rate of population growth and depreciation, and positively on the elasticity of output with respect to capital. Notice also that \(y\) will be constant in the steady state, and its value will be \(y = \left(\frac{s}{\delta+n}\right)^{\frac{a}{1-a}}\)</p>
  </div> 
    
<div class="section-head">    
    <h4>Growth in the Steady State and Technology Progress</h4>    
  </div>
  <div class="eco-text">
    <p>\(k\) is constant in the steady state but given that \(k = K/L \) and \(L\) is growing at a rate \(n\) it is obvious that \(K\) must also grow at a rate \(n\) for the ratio to be constant. Furthermore, because \(y = Y/L\) is also constant in the steady state, \(y\) must also grow at a rate of \(n\). Therefore, growth in the steady state in only dependent on population growth. When adjusting to the steady state, however, the capital to labour ratio will also grow (or shrink if \(k(0) \) is above the steady state ratio) according to \[\frac{dk/dt}{k} = - \left(\delta + n\right) \left[\frac{k(0)^{1-a} - \tfrac{s}{\delta + n}}{k(0)^{1-a} + \tfrac{s}{\delta + n} \left(e^{(1-a) \left(\delta +n \right) t} - 1\right)}   \right] . \tag{6} \] This expression will clearly tend towards zero as \(t\) gets very large, which makes sense because in the long run capital per worker must arrive at its steady state value where is will not change over time. It is also easy to see that at time zero \(\frac{dk/dt}{k} > 0\) if the initial capital stock is below the steady state level, \(\frac{dk/dt}{k} \lt 0\) when it is below the steady state level, and is zero when the economy starts in the steady state. It is worth noting that the denominator of this equation is positive for all positive values of \(t\), as can be seen by \[k(0)^{1-a} + \frac{s}{\delta + n} \left( e^{(1-a) \left(\delta +n \right) t} - 1 \right) > 0 \] \[t > \frac{ln \left(1 - \frac{\left(\delta +n \right) k(0)^{1-a}}{s} \right)}{(1-a) \left(\delta +n \right)}  \ \] because the natural logarithm of any number less than one is negative and every other term in this equation is definitely to be positive. </p>
        
    <p>It is generally believed that technology progress is another source of economic growth in the long run. Incorporating this into the Solow model can be achieved by replacing labour in the production function with 'technology augmented labour'. We will let \(A\) capture the productivity of labour in the economy and assume that \(A = A_0 e^{\alpha t}\), so it grows at a constant rate of \(\alpha\). The economy no longer produces output with simple labour as we defined it in the first section but now uses technology augmented labour, which is expressed as the product of \(L\) and \(A\), so higher value of \(A\) imply that labour is more productive and a given level of labour produces a higher quantity of output at every instant when \(A\) is higher. The production function is now \[Y = K^a \left( AL \right)^b, \] again with \(b = 1-a \). It is important to stress that \(AL\) is an input used in production and the elasticity of output with respect to this variable is \(b\). That is why both \(A\) and \(L\) are raised to the power of \(b\) in this production function. The firm cannot use \(L\) independently of \(A\).</p>
      
    <p>Now define \(y = Y / AL\) and \(k = K/AL \), and call these output per productive worker and capital per productive worker (sometimes the label 'effective worker' is used). From here all the steps in solving the model are the same except we have to work in terms of \(AL\) instead of \(L\). For example, \[ \frac{d}{dt} \frac{K}{AL} = \frac{(AL)(dK/dt) - (K)(dAL/dt)}{(AL)^2} \] \[ \frac{d}{dt} \frac{K}{AL} = \left(s \frac{Y}{AL} - \delta \frac{K}{AL} \right) - (\alpha + n) A_0 L_0 e^{(\alpha + n) t} \frac{K}{AL} \frac{1}{A_0 L_0 e^{(\alpha + n) t}} \] \[ \frac{dk}{dt} = s k^a - (\delta + \alpha + n) k .\] The general solution of this equation is \[ k = \left[ \left( k(0)^{1-a} - \tfrac{s}{\delta + \alpha + n} \right) e^{-(1-a) (\delta + \alpha + n) t} + \tfrac{s}{\delta + \alpha + n} \right]^{\frac{1}{1-a}} \tag{7}  \] and the steady state values of capital per worker and output per worker are \[ k = \left( \frac{s}{\delta + \alpha + n} \right)^{\frac{1}{1-a}}, \hspace{5mm} y = \left( \frac{s}{\delta + \alpha + n} \right)^{\frac{a}{1-a}}. \] Note that the steady state capital stock per productive worker and output per productive worker are decreasing in the rate of technology growth, however, the growth rate of \(Y\) and \(K\) in the steady state must be \(\alpha + n\) to keep \(y\) and \(k\) constant given \(AL\) is growing at a rate of \(\alpha + n\). Therefore, higher values of \(\alpha\) imply convergence to a lower level of capital per productive worker but higher growth in the steady state.</p>
  </div>

    
  <div class="section-head">    
    <h4>The Golden Rule Savings Level</h4>    
  </div>
  <div class="eco-text">
    <p>We assumed that investment in the economy was equal to a fraction of output, which under CRS also means that the same fraction of output per productive worker is used to invest in the capital stock per productive worker. This means the rest of what is produced is available for production, the fraction \((1-s)y\). There is a rate of savings which maximises the level of consumption in the economy, known as the golden rule savings level. Intuitively, this will be the rate which maximises the difference between the production function and the depreciation line. This is the point where the derivatives of the functions are equal \[\frac{dy}{dk} = a k^{a-1} = (\delta + \alpha + n). \] Substituting in the steady state value of \(k\) yields \[a \frac{(\delta + \alpha + n)}{s} = (\delta + \alpha + n) \hspace{3mm} \rightarrow \hspace{5mm} a = s. \] For any saving rate higher than \(a\), the marginal contribution of the installed unit of capital per productive worker to output per productive worker is less than the replacement cost of that unit, which is the amount of output which must be devoted to saving in order to cover the decrease in \(k\) due to productivity growth, population growth, and depreciation. If \(s > a\) the economy could enjoy higher consumption immediately if the saving rate was to decrease. This situation is one of dynamic inefficiency, it is possible to increase consumption in the future without paying the cost of higher savings today. If \(s \lt a\), consumption in the future can only be increased by increasing savings today. This situation is one of dynamic efficiency, there is a cost to be paid in terms of higher saving if agents in the economy are to enjoy higher savings in the future.</p>
  </div>
    

 <div class="section-head">    
    <h4>Numerical Example</h4>    
</div>
<div class="eco-text">
    <p>The interactive example below illustrates the determination of the steady state capital stock per productive worker. \(k\) does not change over time whenever \(sy = \left(\delta + \alpha + n \right)k \) because this is the point where investment exactly offsets the decrease in \(k\) due to depreciation, population growth, and technology change. Therefore, the corresponding points on the horizontal and vertical axis whenever these lines cross are the steady state values of \(k\) and \(y\) respectively. The initial values of the parameters are based on real-world estimates for a developed European economy, and I assume the estimates over the last 20 or 30 years can be taken as long-run values. The initial capital to productive worker labour ratio is set equal to one, which can be viewed as a normalisation to simplify comparisons between future \(k\) and today's \(k\). The depreciation rate of the total capital stock in the Euro area was broadly constant at \(4.6\%\) between the 1980s and early 2000s, but with quite a bit a variation among the different classes of capital assets <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/mb200605_focus04.en.pdf">(ECB 2006)</a>. Labour productivity growth has generally been between \(0\%\) and \(1\%\) for developed Euro Area economies since the start of the millenium <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/economic-bulletin/articles/2021/html/ecb.ebart202107_02~c95a8477e1.en.html">(EBC 2021)</a>. It is hard to see a long-run trend when looking over 100 years of data, but there are clearly certain periods which show relatively higher or lower productivity growth. Therefore, our assumption of constant exogenous growth is unrealistic. Population growth in developed economies is now well below \(1\%\) <a href="https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/field/population-growth-rate/country-comparison/">(CIA, 2023)</a>, far below the rates seen when Solow first laid out his model in 1956, so it is a stretch to argue that the rate of population growth is constant in the long run. But let's just assume current rates will persist into the future. Investment as a proportion of GDP ranged between \(19\%\) and \(25\%\) between 1995 and 2023, so I set the initial value of \(s\) at \(22\%\) <a href="https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/european-union/investment--nominal-gdp#:~:text=Key%20information%20about%20European%20Union%20Investment%3A%20%25%20of%20GDP&text=EU%20investment%20share%20of%20Nominal,of%2019.1%20%25%20in%20Mar%202013.">(CEIC, 2023)</a>. For the elasticity of output with respect to capital, <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpops/ecbocp22.pdf">Musso and Westermann (2005)</a> set \(a=0.4\) when constructing estimates of potential output assuming a Cobb-Douglas CRS production function. Given these parameters, the capital per productive worker stock will be 11.43 and output per productive worker will be 2.65. You can change the values of the initial parameters to see how they affect the steady state.</p>
    <div class="eco-graph">
    <img src="images/solow%202.png">
    </div>
    <p>The next diagram shows how \(k\) will converge to the steady state over time using the same initial parameter values. The first panel shows the growth rate of \(k\) and the second shows the quantity of \(k\). As shown, it will take over 100 years to converge to the steady state capital stock per productive worker. This highlights an important point, even though the Solow model predicts that the economy will always converge towards its steady state capital stock per productive worker when the parameters are such that there is a point where \(sy = \left(\delta + \alpha + n \right)k \), getting there may take many years. For an economy which has an initial \(k(0)\) above the steady state level, this means generations of negative growth.</p>
